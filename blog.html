            <div id="question">1. Difference between local storage and session storage</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A key difference between local storage and session storage is the expiration date. <br><br>

                        localStorage maintains storage across browser sessions. So the storage is saved even if the
                        domain is opened in a new tab or the browser is closed and reopened. There is no term.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        Session storage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab
                        or browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, it creates a new session
                        and new storage.

            <div class="answewr">

                Global scope can be accessed in all the function but block scope only can be accessed inside the block

                        Global scope means that variables can be accessed from any part of the program, any
                        function or conditional condition can access that variable. function or variable defined
                        outside curly braces is called a global variable and has global
                        scope.

                    <li><b> local Scope</b> <br>
                        Local scope means that variables can be accessed only from the declaration part of a block or
                        function.Only the eligible function or block can access that local variable or function.
                        function or variable defined inside curly braces is called a local variable and has local
                        scope.

            <div id="question">3. How event loop works?</div>
            <div class="answewr">Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps
                until it receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call
                stack is empty.There is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
                <br> <br>
                <hr> <br>
                For example, when a user clicks a button on a web page, an event is generated and the event loop will
                execute the callback function associated with that event.

            <div class="answewr">
                undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. he initial value of undefined is : undefined. We
